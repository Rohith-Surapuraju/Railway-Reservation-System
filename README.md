# Railway-Reservation-System
Web application for handling train tickets reservation online using Django. Facilitating the customers for booking the trains of their choice. The client can register as a user under their name and reserve the train they want to travel from one place to another.

This is a web page designed using Django to manage train bookings and related information. This website contains features for logging in and registering if you are a new user. Users can login into the website and search for trains from a particular source to destination on a preferred day. All the list of trains available will be shown to the user. User can book a train of his choice from the list of available trains. Users will be prompted to fill details and pay. They can check their booking history as well. Meanwhile Admin can add or delete new trains from the admin login. Admin can also manage the complete database and provide changes if necessary.

We used html and Django framework to create the web application. We also used Bootstrap for styling. The database we used is the SQLite3 database. We ensured that the userâ€™s data is stored in the database and the administrator can access it.

Functionalities of the web application are: 

1.	Signing in: Users of the website can sign up into the website by providing a username, password, and an email address.

2.	Adding trains: Site administrators can add, update, and remove trains using Django Admin credentials.

3.	Searching: After signing in, users are shown with the total trains that are available on the website. Users can search for a train from a particular source to their destination.

4.	Booking: After selecting a train from the list of available trains shown to the user. Users can provide their details and reserve the train.

5.	View Bookings: Administrators of the website have access to see any bookings that have done so far. Users of the website can also view their booking history by going to the same page.
